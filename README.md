# Secret Network Auction House built using Svelte + TS + Griptape.js + Vite

This website allows users to get information on availible auctions of SNIP-20 tokens, it also allows users to create auctions, set up viewing keys for new tokens. 

This is only a MVP (minimum viable product) built for the Griptape.js Hackathon, and is very special to me as it is my first ever submission into a hackathon!
